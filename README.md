This guide provides an overview of the blockchain architecture simulation I've developed for the distributed systems project. The simulation showcases key blockchain features including transaction processing, consensus mechanisms, and security features.

## üìò Project Overview

This implementation demonstrates a peer-to-peer blockchain system with:

- Block creation and transaction management  
- Hash-based block chaining  
- Distributed consensus through a proof-of-work mechanism  
- Network simulation with multiple nodes  
- Transaction validation and malicious node detection

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Data Structures

1. **Transactions**
   - Sender and receiver addresses  
   - Transaction amount  
   - Timestamp  

2. **Blocks**
   - Block index  
   - Timestamp  
   - Array of transactions  
   - Previous block hash  
   - Current block hash  
   - Pointer to next block  

3. **Blockchain**
   - Linked list of blocks  
   - Current proof-of-work value  
   - Mutex for thread safety  

4. **Network Nodes**
   - Unique node identifier  
   - Local blockchain copy  
   - Mining thread  
   - Status flags (running, malicious)  
   - Mining rewards tracking

## üîë Key System Features

### 1. Transaction Processing  
Transactions are validated before being added to the pending transaction pool:
- Sender must exist in the system  
- Sender must have sufficient funds  
- Pending transactions are grouped into blocks (3 per block)  

### 2. Block Chaining with Hash  
Each block contains a hash of its own content and the previous block's hash, creating a tamper-evident chain:

### 3. Consensus Mechanism  
The consensus mechanism implements a simplified proof-of-work algorithm:

1. Starts with the previous proof value  
2. Increments the value until finding one that satisfies two conditions:  
   - Not divisible by 2 (odd number)  
   - Divisible by 3  
3. Returns the valid proof value  

While simplified compared to real blockchain implementations, this mechanism demonstrates key consensus principles:
- Requires computational work to find valid proofs  
- Proof validity is easily verifiable  
- Adjusts difficulty based on network state  

### 4. Mining Process  
The mining process occurs in several steps:

1. Wait for enough transactions to form a block  
2. Copy pending transactions to local storage  
3. Attempt to find a valid proof of work  
4. Create a new block with:  
   - Current transactions  
   - Previous block hash  
   - Valid proof of work  
5. For malicious nodes, possibly tamper with transaction data  
6. Broadcast the new block to all nodes  
7. Reset the transaction pool  

This process simulates the competitive nature of blockchain mining, where nodes race to find valid proofs and add blocks to the chain.

### 5. Security Features  
The system includes protections against malicious behavior:
- Transaction validation prevents double-spending  
- Malicious nodes are simulated to test system resilience

## üß™ System Testing

The implementation includes test scenarios to verify system functionality:

### 1. Valid Transaction Testing  
Demonstrates normal blockchain operation with valid transactions.

### 2. Invalid Transaction Testing  
Shows how the system rejects transactions with:
- Insufficient funds  
- Non-existent sender accounts  

### 3. Malicious Node Testing  
Tests system resilience with different percentages of malicious nodes:
- <50% malicious nodes (2 out of 8)  
- 50% malicious nodes (5 out of 8)  

---

## üìä System Evaluation

The simulation successfully demonstrates key blockchain features:

### 1. Transaction Integrity:
- Valid transactions are processed correctly  
- Invalid transactions are rejected  

### 2. Block Chaining:
- Blocks are properly linked through hash references  
- Block history is maintained consistently  

### 3. Distributed Consensus:
- Nodes reach agreement on the blockchain state  
- Mining rewards are distributed fairly  

### 4. Security:
- System maintains integrity with minority malicious nodes  
- Demonstrates vulnerability when majority of nodes are malicious

## üîß Implementation Details

The project is implemented in C using:

- POSIX threads for concurrency  
- Mutex locks for thread safety  
- Condition variables for synchronization  
- Simple hash functions for block chaining (since it‚Äôs for educational purpose)

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This blockchain simulation demonstrates the fundamental architecture of distributed ledger systems. It helped me understand the architecture in a more practical and fun way!
